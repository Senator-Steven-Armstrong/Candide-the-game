bandit_lore = """
Bandits are one of the most common foes you will meet. They roam the land, looking for 
innocents to steal from and kill. Bandits are quite average in every category of a fight, 
but that does not mean they should be underestimated.
"""

cannibal_lore = """
Cannibals are the subordinates of the Långöron. They are generally weaker than them,
but there are stronger individuals among them that can rival their superiors in strength.
They are ferocious and when they've got your scent they will not cease their hunt until stopped.
Some cannibals have left their original tribe to start their own in the jungle, so you may encounter them often.
"""

långöron_lore = """
The Långöron are the leaders of the cannibal tribes are at the physical peak. They often stand over 7 feet tall,
and carry weapons that can deal massive damage, and their training has made them very fast. It is believed they have a certain connection to nature, 
and follow a deity by the name of Eivor. This may be the cause of their physical prowess.
"""

traveler_lore = """
Travelers are very large humans, towering above the average person. They carry an enormous sword in honor 
of their culture. This sword, combined with superior size, provides a very large advantage in combat. 
While Travelers are very strong, due to their size they fall behind in speed. 
Legends say Travelers also have capabilities of magic. Do not challenge these foes if you are not ready.
"""

goblin_lore = """
Goblins are lowly creatures, often found in packs looking for people to steal from and kill for sport.
They are very weak except for being extremely fast. Despite being weak alone, their strength is in their numbers.
Do not approach if your speed is low, and do not linger in the heat of battle, for others could be on their way.

The sweet Kunigunda is Candide's betrothen. Candide is currently looking for her,
in hope that they might one day be together again.
"""

shopkeeper_lore = """
Not much is known about the shopkeeper. He always manages to find us on our journey
despite our constant traveling to many different locations. This is especially curious,
since we have never told him where we are going. 

It seems like what happens never surprises him, almost as if he knows what will happen.
We have asked him several times how he manages to obtain these items, but he always
laughs it off saying 'I have my ways'.
