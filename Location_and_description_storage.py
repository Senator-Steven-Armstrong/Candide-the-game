#SHOP
shop_travel_description1 = '''
You traveled to the legendary IKEA, known for forging The Legendary Smörkniv, constructing the fort of Fredrik
and their exotic variety of foods such as: Meatballs,
'''
shop_travel_description2 = '''
After a long and perilous journey, wandering across the hostile ice lands known as Finland, you find yourself in
front of a mysterious building, with a partly destroyed sign reading "K-Market Tikkurila, property of Valma Vä-".
Inside were vast amounts of consumables, mostly whatever edible material the people of these lands can acquire.
This place could store precious items, but you should leave before the owner returns, for she is beyond you.
'''
shop_travel_description3 = '''
While your local advisor claimed that this place was not far, this journey has felt like an eternity. 
Just as you are on the verge of giving in to the horribly negative energy of the region known as Täby, 
you spot a blue and yellow light through the poisonous fog. 
You muster all of your strength and make it through the magic self-opening doors.
Then, you are met with a familiar face. It is the same advisor who sent you on this perilous voyage.
He laughs maniacally, knowing you have spent half a century venturing to this place.
Finally, he speaks: "Welcome, traveler, to Lidl. I am Kasper, The patient one. What do you wish to purchase?"

#ELDORADO
eldorado_travel_description1 = '''
As you continue your journey, you walk through a dense forest. While in the forest you find yourself on the
wrong side of a small river. While trying to cross it you accidentally slip in. You hit your head on some
rocks and everying turns black...
When you wake up the first thing you see is gold. "Am I in heaven?", you wonder. You sit up and look around.
You seem to be in some sort of palace, it's beautiful, gemstones and riches covering every surface. There are 
other people in the room with you, and a man with a bigger silhouette enters. The other people respectfully
greet him. He comes closer, greets you with a smile, and introduces himself as the "King" of Eldorado,
the mystical country enshrouded in legend.
You stay there in peace for one month, but soon come to an ultimatum. You can't keep Kunigunda waiting anymore.
Either you stay, a peaceful life in Eldorado but without the love of your life. Or you leave,
go to the dark hell that is the rest of the world, but let Kuniganda light it up when you finally save her.
'''
eldorado_travel_description2 = '''
You keep on wandering throughout the world, eventually stumbling onto a small river with a rickety boat
tied up neabry. No one seems to have used the boat for years and your legs ache after all the walking,
so you decide to take it and ride downstream. The once small forest around you becomes denser, and the river
even thinner. Eventually you reach what seems to be the end of the river, a tight tunnel. You smash into 
multiple rocks until one of them breaks your boat. 
You hit your head on it and everything becomes black...
You wake up on a small shore, covered in shining gems. Just as you start to awake a small group of people
closes in and picks you up. You are carried for a while, until eventually stopping inside a great palace.
A big man on a big chair introduces himself as the "King" of Eldorado, the hidden land of endless riches.
He happily lets you stay and the locals help you recover, but fate eventually catches up to you one month later.
You either stay and live happily in Eldorado, without Kunigunda, or you leave,
conquering the rest of your journey, and eventually the rest of your life with Kunigunda.
